A simple package meant to contain readable implementations of various Weibull-related analysis tools and techniques.

Waloddi Weibull invented the weibull distribution.

The weibull distribution is commonly used to model duration-until-event scenarios.
Examples include amount of time until a widget breaks, customer churn rates, and
number of times one could bend a paperclip until it snaps.

The weibull distribution is particularly useful for this modeling as it can
reduce to the exponential and rayleigh distributions as well as approximate
a normal distribution. It can also model both early life failure (e.g. defects
in a semiconductor) as well as wear out failure (e.g. creep in metal structures).

This package is an aggregation of various simple 2-parameter weibull functions,
useful for modeling duration-until-event scenarios and learning about the
properties of the weibull distribution.
